AceUnit is a comfortable unit test framework for C, in the best
tradition of xUnit frameworks (like JUnit). Its target audience are
developers using the C programming language to develop firmware,
drivers, operating systems, and other C programs, like command line
programs. It is tiny and thus suitable even for extremely
resource-constrained environments.
